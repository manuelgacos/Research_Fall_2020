Dear Chris

Hello Professor, I hope this mail finds you well and healthy. I apologize for the late response. I successfully ran the deisotoping function on the original data. 

After some debugging I completed the function to erase the peaks given given the distance condition.  The output that I get has a similar structure as the original data. 

- First object is a data frame with information about each entry with columns 'sequence', 'charge', 'First.Scan' (from SEQUEST dataset) and 'precursorMZ' (extracted from 'Headers').

- Second object is the list of matrices after deleting peaks with the given condition.

- As with the original data, each row on the data frame corresponds to a matrix in the second object.

My function didn't have any issues working with the dataset after running the deisotoping function. 

I'm loosing the name of the rows after running Deisotope
Returns a data frame and not a matrix

I wanted to ask you if I should do the scaling, log transform, mean 0 before running the function I wrote (the one which delete peaks) OR after it?
